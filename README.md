## Grundlagen der Programmierung Wintersemester 2021/22

This is used as repository for a course at Graz University in term WS 2021/22.

**Attention**: This is work in progress an will grow over the next months.

If you are not a student in this course I'd suggest to use the (full) course from last year, which can be found here:
